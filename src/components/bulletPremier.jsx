                    <p> It is an unfortunate fact that most security personnel do not have the required protective gears needed to keep them safe in the line of duty. Unfortunately, some have had to pay with their lives simply because they were not provided protective equipment.

                        <br /> <br />This has affected the morale of officers and subsequently their response to attitude to work on the simple excuse of being ill-equipped to face any gun threat.

                        <br /><br />Our Ultra-Light Bulletproof Plates are designed to withstand multiple shots from armour-piercing rifles and similar weapons. Our vest has been subjected to live-testing and evaluation by the Nigerian Defence and certified fit for use by soldiers.
